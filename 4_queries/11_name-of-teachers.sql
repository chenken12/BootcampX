/*
Name of Teachers That Assisted

We need to know which teachers actually assisted 
students during any cohort.

Select the instructor's name and the cohort's name.
Don't repeat the instructor's name in the results list.
Order by the instructor's name.
This query needs to select data for a cohort with a specific name, use 'JUL02' for the cohort's name here.

  JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
  JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id
  WHERE cohorts.name = 'JUL02'
